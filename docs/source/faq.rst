**Why do I need at least 100 deaths to run the InSilicoVA algorithm?**
    While it is possible to run InSilicoVA with fewer deaths, our experience
    suggests that the results are more reliable with larger sample sizes.  In
    our experimentation with VA data (with external causes assigned), 100 deaths
    provided to be a reasonable threshold for obtaining reliable results.
