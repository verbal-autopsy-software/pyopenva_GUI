# pyopenVA_GUI

Graphical User Interface for the openVA tool implemented in Python.

## Details

* Developing with PyQt5 with Python 3.9.10 

* Building app/executable with `python pyinstaller.py`

  + includes OS-specific calls (only 'darwin' has been tested so far)

## To Do

* Can we set up continuous integration service that builds executables/apps and
adds them (for different OS's) to this site as releases?
